	<h2><a href="#">Sales Performance Dashabord<br />
	</a></h2>
	<p>
		Presenting your team with the most updated infromation about the department's performance is priceless and has so many 
		advantages, such as (but not limited to):
		* Can Help the Team Set Goals
		* Improves Collaboration Between Departments
		* Sales Department Dashboard Allows for More Accountability
		* Helps to Increase Motivation Within the Team
		* Keeps Sales Teams From Working in Isolation
		
		
		The Dashboard showed below helps you visualize Sales KPI's so that they can be kept under the radar and more importantly, 
		under control.
	<p>
		The report starts with Top level information, by showing 3 Sales KPI's for 2022: Total Sales in USD and Units and the MSRP 
		vs Unit Price ratio. 
	<p>	
		In addition, just one line below those 3 Top KPI's, you can find 2 charts showing what was the Sales behavior by Month and 
		what was the contribution by Product Line, first by USD, followed by the total units sold. 
	<p>
		Moreover, we can notice what is the Sales in USD by country (USA and Canada) and what is the Total Sales range by country 
		and where their Total Sales maximum, minimum and mean lies. 
	<p>
		Finally, the dashboard presents a Map Tree depicting the sales distribution by Customer, so that we can easily identify who 
		the big players in our business are. 
	<p>
		More information can be added as the Sales Department sees fit. 
	<p>
